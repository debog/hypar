1D-1V VLASOV EQUATION IN LOG FORM: TWO-STREAM INSTABILITY

  d(log f)       d(log f)         d(log f)
  -------  +  v ---------  +  E ----------  =  0
     dt            dx                dv

   0 <= x <= 2pi;   Periodic
  -7 <= v <= 7; Homogenous Dirichlet

NOTE: This example requires HyPar be compiled
with the FFTW library.

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters 
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution

** See hypar/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the (log form) initial
solution file(s) in the correct format required by the solver.  
The code aux/post_process_log.c is an example to convert the 
solution file(s) to distribution f.
