    just calls the macro #_Euler1DRoeAverage_ and is not used by any
    functions within the 1D Euler module. However, it's necessary to define it
    and provide it to the the solver object (#HyPar) so that it can then send it
    to interpolation functions for a characteristic-based reconstruction.
