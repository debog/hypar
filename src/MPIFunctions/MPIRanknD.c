/*!
  This function computes the n-dimensional rank, given the 1D rank and the total
  number of MPI ranks along each spatial dimension.

  \b 1D \b Rank: This is the rank of the process in the communicator.\n
  \b n-Dimensional \b Rank: This represents an integer array, where each element
  is the rank of the process along a spatial dimension.

  Consider a 2D simulation running with 21 MPI ranks - 7 along the \a x direction,
  and 3 along the \a y direction, as shown in the following figure:

  @image latex nd_ranks.eps width=0.9\textwidth
  The boldface number in the parentheses is the n-dimensional rank (n=2), while the
  number below it in normal typeface is the 1D rank, corresponding to the rank in
  the MPI communicator.

  Note:
  + the array to hold the computed n-dimensional rank must be preallocated and the size
    must be equal to the number of spatial dimensions.
