/*!
  This function returns the 1D rank, given the n-dimensional rank and the total
  number of MPI ranks along each spatial dimension.

  \b 1D \b Rank: This is the rank of the process in the communicator.\n
  \b n-Dimensional \b Rank: This represents an integer array, where each element
  is the rank of the process along a spatial dimension.

  Consider a 2D simulation running with 21 MPI ranks - 7 along the \a x direction,
  and 3 along the \a y direction, as shown in the following figure:

  The boldface number in the parentheses is the n-dimensional rank (n=2), while
  the number below it in normal typeface is the 1D rank, corresponding to the rank
  in the MPI communicator.
