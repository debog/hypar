/*!
  Return auxiliary solution: Some time integrators may have the concept of
  auxiliary solutions that they evolve along with the main solution #HyPar::u
  (these may be used for error estimation, for example). This function returns
  a pointer to such an auxiliary solution. Note that the auxiliary solution has
  the same dimensions and array layout as the main solution.
  + Call with the final argument \a n less than 0 to get the total number of
    auxiliary solutions (this value will be stored in the argument \a N at
    exit).
  + Call with the final argument \a n less than or equal to zero to get the
    \a n-th auxiliary solution (the argument \a uaux will point to this at
    exit).

  Note that auxiliary solutions are numbered in the C convention: 0,1,...,N-1.

  Time integration methods which use auxiliary solutions currently implemented:
  + General Linear Methods with Global Error Estimators (GLM-GEE - #_GLM_GEE_)
    (see TimeGLMGEE(), TimeGLMGEEInitialize() ).
